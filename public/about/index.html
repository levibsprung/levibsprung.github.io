      <p>How I would describe myself in a few paragraphs.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I? <a href="#who-am-i" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I am a Computer Science graduate (B.S. 2025) and Data Science student (M.S. 2026) at Colorado School of Mines. I pride myself in how much I&rsquo;ve gotten out of my interests and hobbies, such as games (Magic: The Gathering, poker, chess, Scrabble), physical activities (skiing, rock climbing), learning languages (Spanish, Italian), and music (primarily musical theatre currently).</p>
<h2 id="what-am-i-doing">What am I doing? <a href="#what-am-i-doing" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I am spending this summer working on my software engineering skills. In addition to this website, I&rsquo;m working on a Scrabble database that allows users to upload games using only a photo of the game board and a list of scores, as well as exploring reinforcement learning with Scrabble. I am also looking to write about my interests and the lessons they have taught me.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-goals">What are my goals? <a href="#what-are-my-goals" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve long wanted a place to catalog my ideas and experiences, so in this website&rsquo;s initial stages, that will be its primary purpose. Ideally, as I continue to work on more projects, it will also serve to showcase and document those.</p>
