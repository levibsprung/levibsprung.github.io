How I would describe myself in a few paragraphs.

## Who am I?


I am a Computer Science graduate (B.S. 2025) and Data Science student (M.S. 2026) at Colorado School of Mines. I pride myself in how much I've gotten out of my interests and hobbies, such as games (Magic: The Gathering, poker, chess, Scrabble), physical activities (skiing, rock climbing), learning languages (Spanish, Italian), and music (primarily musical theatre currently).

## What am I doing?


I am spending this summer working on my software engineering skills. In addition to this website, I'm working on a Scrabble database that allows users to upload games using only a photo of the game board and a list of scores, as well as exploring reinforcement learning with Scrabble. I am also looking to write about my interests and the lessons they have taught me.

## What are my goals?


I've long wanted a place to catalog my ideas and experiences, so in this website's initial stages, that will be its primary purpose. Ideally, as I continue to work on more projects, it will also serve to showcase and document those.
