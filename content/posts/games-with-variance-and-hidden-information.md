## Background

Since the pandemic, I've made games a part of my lifestyle. I started playing Magic: The Gathering competitively in 2019, it being one of my primary sources of motivation until 2022, when at some point I shifted more focus towards school. In 2023, I started playing poker (Texas hold-em) with some friends weekly with low stakes, which has persisted to the time of writing this post. 

## Hidden information

Hidden information is a core component of both Magic and poker. In poker, a significant part of one's mental process is devoted to determining what may be in other people's hands based on their previous patterns of play and how they have played the current hand. This is also a core component of Magic, although it is far less emphasized until a certain level of play. 

In a game of Magic, what is unknown often exceeds what is known significantly. The first aspect of this is the opponent's deck. Oftentimes a player can limit the amount of uncertainty on this axis via thorough preparation for the given event. This can look like learning each card that the player could possibly play against or learning what cards certain deck archetypes tend to play. While some events naturally soften this source of uncertainty by revealing decklists to players' opponents before the match, players still have a sideboard of up to 15 cards, from which they can 'bench' cards in their deck and 'start' cards from their sideboard between games. 

The other aspect is what is in the opponent's hand. Similar to poker, information can be gleaned from how the opponent has played, although there are far more variables in Magic (player's deck, opponent's deck, large domain of board states). This effect can make it hard to know what to look for in a game, and has often led me to giving up on gaining such edges and instead focusing more on concrete ideas or relying on heuristics to make decisions (which I often do in poker as well if I want to do less thinking).

Where am I going with this? Hidden information adds layers of complexity to games that cannot be accessed in other ways. There is practically no limit to how much thought and effort people can put into using the information they have to attempt to make predictions about the unknown information. Being able to play the game from the opponent's perspective is a particularly beneficial skill, which itself requires you to know the opponent's patterns of play, and in Magic, also requires an understanding of the opponent's deck. But to answer my question, I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I just think it's cool mostly.

## Stakes

Adding stakes to games is a scalable in magnitude and effective way to control and add seriousness to a game. Introducing or increasing stakes will likely increase how much time and energy players put into various decisions, such as figuring out a player's range of possible cards in their hand. Some players may not need external influences such as stakes to lock in, but for others (such as myself), stakes are a form of discipline,
